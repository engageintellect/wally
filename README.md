## Bitcoin Wallet Generator

Wally is a simple Bitcoin wallet generator that generates a Bitcoin wallet address and private key. It is written in Next.js and uses the [btc-wallet-generator](https://github.com/engageintellect/btc-wallet-generator) to generate the keys via an API endpoint.

## Getting Started

To get started, clone the repository and install the dependencies.

```bash

```

**NOTE:** You will also need to run the backend server to successfully run the client. You can find the backend server code [here](https://github.com/engageintellect/btc-wallet-generator)
